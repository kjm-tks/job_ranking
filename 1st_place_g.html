            <h4 class="h4">What is the job?</h4>
            <p>The pastry chef job is overwhelmingly popular among girls.</p>

            <p>The working hours average around 10 hours, starting early in the morning, which requires physical stamina, but it feels rewarding!<br>
                However, around Christmas, there may be longer overtime...<br>
                • Recipe creation and adjustment: Creating and adjusting recipes for cakes and desserts.<br>
                • Ingredient preparation and management: Measuring and managing the inventory of ingredients.<br>
                • Product manufacturing: Making desserts such as cakes, pies, cookies, and chocolates.<br>
                • Decoration and finishing: Applying beautiful decorations to desserts to enhance their appearance.<br>
                • Hygiene management: Ensuring cleanliness and hygiene to maintain food safety.<br>
                • Customer service: Taking orders from customers and providing desserts according to their requests.<br>
                • Menu updates: Updating the menu with new seasonal items and trends. These are the main tasks.</p>
            <p>Workplaces include patisseries, restaurants, hotels, and food manufacturers.<br>
                In smaller places, one person might handle everything from making items to decorating them, but in large specialized factories, there are more workers and a higher volume of production, so tasks may be divided.<br>
                The reason pastry chefs start their day early is to make all the products before the store opens!<br>
                This is my personal impression, but it seems that it's easier to utilize your ideas in smaller stores!</p>

        <div id="popularity">
            <h4 class="h4">Why is being a pastry chef popular?</h4>
            <p>Considering that, why is being a pastry chef popular?<br>

            <h4 class="hh4">How to become a pastry chef</h4>
            <p>To become a pastry chef, it is generally necessary to acquire knowledge and skills at a confectionery vocational school or culinary school and work in patisseries, restaurants, or factories.<br>
                Some people also train under famous pastry chefs...<br>
                Making sweets requires not only a love for the craft but also the perseverance to make the same items repeatedly.<br>
                Other skills needed include aesthetic sense and communication skills.<br>
                If you want to own your own shop someday, sales and customer service skills are also necessary.</p>
            <p>Qualifications are not required, but national qualifications like the "Pastry Hygiene Master," which certifies knowledge of hygiene required for handling food, and the "Confectionery Manufacturing Skills Master," which certifies technical skills, are useful for employment.</p>
            <p>☆ Fun Fact<br>
                Many competitions are held domestically and internationally where pastry chefs compete in their skills.<br>
                Among them, the "Coupe du Monde de la Pâtisserie," held in France every two years, is one of the world's top competitions, and winning it brings global recognition.<br>
                Competitions are often streamed on YouTube, so if you're interested, you should search for them.</p>
