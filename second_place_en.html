        <h4 class="iei">What kind of job is it?</h4>
        <p>Content 2 is about being a YouTuber. Being a YouTuber can be a main job or a side job, but what exactly does it involve? <br>You can join YouTube's Partner Program from the age of 18 and earn advertising revenue. <br>It's a system where you earn money based on the number of views your videos receive.</p>
        <p>Although it's possible to make a living solely from video distribution, only a handful of people actually do so. <br>Because anyone can try their hand at it, the number of YouTubers continues to grow, leading to intense competition.</p>
        <span class="highlight">What is YouTube's Partner Program?</span><br>
        The YouTube Partner Program (YPP) offers opportunities to earn money on YouTube. <br>To join this program, you must meet the following requirements: <br> • Have more than 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 total watch hours in the past 12 months, or <br> • Have 10 million views on Shorts in the past 90 days <br> • Not have violated policies <br> • Be in a supported country or region <br> • Have two-step verification enabled on your Google account</p>
        <p>If your application is approved, you can earn money from ad revenue and Super Chats. <br>Channels that are inactive for more than 6 months may lose monetization, so it's important to upload videos regularly!</p>

    <div id="earnings">
        <h4 class="iei">How much can you earn on YouTube?</h4>
        <p>It depends on popularity, but how much can you earn from advertising revenue? <br> Research shows that YouTube doesn't have a fixed amount per view; instead, revenue is based on cost per thousand views (CPM). <br> Advertisers pay an amount per thousand views, and CPM is higher in the U.S. and Europe. <br> From CPM, YouTube takes a fee of about 30% to 45%.</p>
        <p>Additionally, if users do not skip ads or click on ads, CPM can sometimes increase… <br> In conclusion, the revenue per view is often around 0.1 to 0.5 yen. But, as mentioned, it also depends on popularity!</p>
