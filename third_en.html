        <h4 class="h4">What does the job involve?</h4>
        <p>There are mainly two types of doctors.<br>Doctors who interact with patients and provide treatment in hospitals or clinics are called "Clinical Doctors".<br>Clinical doctors are further divided into specialties such as internal medicine, surgery, orthopedics, pediatrics, ophthalmology, dermatology, etc.<br>Among these "Clinical Doctors," those who own their own private practices are referred to as "Private Practitioners".<br> They may provide care across multiple fields to handle various symptoms.</p>
        <p>Finally, there are "Research Doctors," whose goal is to research disease mechanisms and new treatments.<br>Research doctors study even conditions considered incurable, discovering treatments and advancing medical science.</p>
        <p>Doctors also work in places beyond hospitals and clinics, including universities, research institutes, and companies.<br>For instance, "Occupational Physicians" conduct health checks and consultations in companies, and there are also doctors who provide home visits.<br>Furthermore, doctors are needed in various settings such as "Public Health Centers," "Pharmaceutical Companies," "Insurance Companies," and "Facilities for the Elderly," supporting community health and hygiene.</p>
